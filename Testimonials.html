              <p class="mbr-fonts-style  display-7">“Perma-Dry is the best company to contact if you have a basement or crawl space problem.”<br>“After hearing estimates from aprox. 3 different companies to help remove standing water from my crawl space, with no positive results except outrageous estimates and lies, I contacted Mike Elinski at PermaDry. There is no charge for a service call, his men did an awesome job of finding out the problem. After 3 companies telling me it was ground water or sewage or whatever they THOUGHT, Mike did a thorough investigation of the crawl space and found it was pipes under the bathroom that had broken and not just ground water and/or sewage coming up. He even had the plumbers come out on a Sunday to work on the problem. He also offered to assist in any part that we may have wanted to do ourselves to save money. In the end, the job was done, pictures were e-mailed to me to show the before and after and the problem is solved. I recommend PermaDry to anyone in need of this service....you can be sure to be told the truth and have the job done correctly and at a great price!!!!!”</p>

              <p class="mbr-fonts-style  display-7">“WONDERFUL!!!! ”<br>“My basement flooded on Wednesday 11/30/11. I kind of started to panic as the water just kept coming in and I had no idea what needed to be done. I started calling basement waterproofing companies. I think Perma-dry was maybe the 3rd company I contacted. The first company made me an appointment for the next day. The next company made me an appointment for 3 weeks and then I called Mike. He came right out. Not really even to "sell" the job, but just to look at my basement and tell us what was going on. I could have stopped then and hired him. But of course I shopped around got some prices, met with several companies. Dealt with some awful companies and very poor customer service. During this time my husband was also strongly considering installing our new drain tile system himself. I remembered Mike and ended up calling him a few times. Each time I called him he offered advice and his services. Finally we hired his company. He got me in right away, showed up right on time and his crew did a WONDERFUL job!! He followed through with every word he said. Gave me a great price. His crew was considerate, respectful and as neat as possible doing such a dirty job. I couldn't possibly be more pleased. Even when they used the garden hose to clean off my driveway they were careful not to bump my Christmas decorations. Now my basement is waterproofed and I gave the business to a great company. They even came back after the cement dried to clean my basement floor and clean the carpet on my stairs! I highly recommend Perma-dry to anyone in need of their services.”</p>
